# Running and self-hosting HireFlow

Run it on your own computer (the usual way: [README](../README.md#quick-start)), or on a server of your own.

## One-command start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saksham-eng560/HireFlow.git && cd HireFlow
./start.sh                 # macOS / Linux / WSL — needs Python 3.11+ and Node 20+
```

The first run creates `.env` with fresh secrets, a Python virtualenv, installs Chromium and the npm
packages, and prepares a local SQLite database. Later runs start in seconds and only reinstall when
requirements change. It then runs the API (:8000), the dashboard (:3000) and the task queue, opens
your browser and streams the logs. **Ctrl-C stops everything.**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./start.sh` | Local mode, no Docker. Uses Redis + a Celery worker + beat if `redis-server` is installed, otherwise runs tasks in-process with a built-in scheduler (scheduled scans still happen). |
| `./start.sh --demo` | Practice mode, with its own database: create any account, applications go to a bundled careers site with fictional companies, nothing real is sent, and everything resets nightly. |
| `./start.sh --sample` | Also seeds a sample account (`demo@example.com` / `demo-password-123`) with a swipe deck, and serves the standalone sample careers site on :8765. |
| `./start.sh --prod` | Production build of the dashboard (faster pages). |
| `./start.sh --docker` | The full Docker Compose stack (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, worker, beat). `./start.sh --stop` stops it. |
| `./start.sh --reset` | Wipes the local database first. |
| `./start.sh --ollama` | Sets up a free AI model on this computer with Ollama: checks it, downloads the model, fills in `.env` (see [AI models](AI_MODELS.md)). |
| `start.bat` | Windows: the Docker path (`start.bat stop` to stop). Or use WSL and `./start.sh`. |

Your first ten minutes:

1. **Create your account** at http://localhost:3000/register.
2. **Upload your resume** in Resume Lab (PDF, DOCX or pasted text) and check the parsed result.
3. **Settings › Mass apply › Internships**: one click adds the internship lists and startup boards.
4. **Settings › Saved answers**: save work authorization and visa sponsorship. Without them, kept jobs
   stop in Needs approval instead of being submitted.
5. **Scan for jobs now**, then open **Swipe Review** and start swiping.

Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` to `.env` for much better scoring, tailoring and answers, or run
`./start.sh --ollama` for a free model on your own computer (everything also works without either, on
built-in heuristics). `make start` does the same as `./start.sh`.

## Quick start (Docker)

Requirements: Docker with Compose v2, about 4 GB RAM free.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saksham-eng560/HireFlow.git
cd HireFlow
scripts/init-env.sh      # creates a private .env with freshly generated secrets
```

Open `.env` in a text editor and paste your Anthropic API key where indicated. This is optional but
strongly recommended. Your keys stay in `.env` on your own machine, and git is set up to never commit
that file. Don't share it or paste keys on the command line.

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d        # or: make up
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | http://localhost:3000 |
| API docs (OpenAPI) | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health | http://localhost:8000/health/ready |

This starts PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, the API (which runs database migrations on start), a Celery
worker with Chromium, Celery beat, and the dashboard. Open the dashboard, create your account, and
follow the **Get your agent ready** checklist.

Optional: `docker compose exec api python scripts/seed_db.py` creates a sample account
(`demo@example.com` / `demo-password-123`) with sample data, so every page has something to show.
`./start.sh --docker --demo` runs the stack in demo mode instead (see [Demo mode](USER_GUIDE.md#demo-mode)).

## Local development without Docker

`./start.sh` does all of the following for you; the individual steps are here if you prefer them.

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Node 20+, PostgreSQL 16 with the `pgvector` extension (or SQLite for a
quick try), and Redis (optional with `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=true`).

```bash
make setup          # backend venv + deps + Chromium, dashboard deps, .env
make migrate        # alembic upgrade head (or create tables on SQLite)
make api            # FastAPI on :8000 (reload)
make worker         # Celery worker        ┐ or set CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=true
make beat           # Celery beat schedule ┘ and skip both
make web            # Next.js dev server on :3000
make demo           # demo careers site on :8765
```

Simplest possible setup, with no Postgres or Redis: set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/hireflow.db`,
`CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=true` and `REDIS_URL=` in `.env`, then run `make api` and `make web`.
Scheduled scans need beat and Redis.

### Coming from AutoApply AI

HireFlow was previously called AutoApply AI. The database name changed with it: `hireflow` (user,
password and database) in Docker, and `backend/data/hireflow.db` for `./start.sh`. A fresh install
starts empty. To keep your old data:

- **Local SQLite** (`./start.sh`): copy `backend/data/autoapply.db` to `backend/data/hireflow.db`.
- **PostgreSQL**: point `DATABASE_URL` at your old database and run `cd backend && alembic stamp --purge 0001`
  once. The six old migrations are now one revision, so this marks the existing schema as current.
- Either way, keep the same `SECRET_KEY` / `ENCRYPTION_KEY` so stored tokens stay readable. Everyone
  signs in once more, because the session cookie is now `hireflow_session`.
- Applications you logged by hand without a link have a placeholder URL with the old name. To fix them,
  run `UPDATE jobs SET source_url = replace(source_url, 'https://manual.autoapply.invalid/', 'https://manual.hireflow.invalid/') WHERE source_url LIKE 'https://manual.autoapply.invalid/%';`
- Reload the unpacked Chrome extension from the `extension/` folder.

Other useful commands:

```bash
make help                                                   # everything available
backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/test_scraper.py greenhouse --source stripe -k "Software Engineer"
backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/test_scraper.py url https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/stripe/jobs/123
backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/migrate.py --reembed       # after changing EMBEDDING_PROVIDER
```

## On your own server (optional)

### Free, always on: Oracle Cloud "Always Free"

Oracle's Always Free tier includes an ARM server with up to 4 cores and 24 GB of RAM that doesn't
expire. That's enough to run everything 24/7 at no cost.

1. **Create an account** at https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/. A card is needed for verification
   but isn't charged. Your *home region* can't be changed later, so pick one near you.
2. **Create the server.** Go to **Compute → Instances → Create instance** and set:
   - **Image**: Canonical Ubuntu 24.04.
   - **Shape**: *Change shape → Ampere → VM.Standard.A1.Flex*, 4 OCPUs and 24 GB memory. It's
     labelled "Always Free-eligible".
   - **Networking**: keep "Create new virtual cloud network" and "Assign a public IPv4 address".
   - **SSH keys**: *Generate a key pair* and **download the private key**.

   If you see "Out of capacity", try another availability domain, try 2 OCPUs / 12 GB, or retry
   later. This is common for free ARM servers.
3. **Open ports 80 and 443.** On the instance page, click the subnet, then its **Security List**,
   then **Add Ingress Rules**. Set source CIDR `0.0.0.0/0`, IP protocol TCP, and destination port
   range `80,443`.
4. **Connect and run the setup script.** The instance page shows the public IP address.
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/Downloads/ssh-key-*.key
   ssh -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-*.key ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saksham-eng560/HireFlow/main/scripts/server-setup.sh | bash
   ```
   [`scripts/server-setup.sh`](../scripts/server-setup.sh) does the rest:
   - installs Docker and opens the server's own firewall (Oracle's Ubuntu image blocks everything
     except SSH);
   - generates fresh secrets into `~/hireflow/.env`;
   - builds and starts the stack with HTTPS. The first build takes about 10 minutes.

   It prints your URL when it's done. Without a `DOMAIN`, the URL is
   `https://<ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io`, a free hostname that points at your server.
5. **Add your API key privately.** On the server, run `nano ~/hireflow/.env`, paste your
   Anthropic key into its line, and save. Then restart:
   `cd ~/hireflow && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`. Editing the file keeps the
   key out of your shell history and out of git. The file is readable only by your user.
6. **Open the URL and create your account.** Then turn off sign-ups as the script's output shows.

Useful follow-ups:
- **Your own domain**: point its DNS A record at the server, then re-run the script with
  `DOMAIN=jobs.example.com` in front of `bash`. A real domain is recommended before connecting
  Google.
- **Changing settings**: edit `~/hireflow/.env`, then run
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` in that folder.
- **Updating**: re-run the script.
- **Free AI on the server**: re-run the script with `WITH_OLLAMA=1` in front of `bash`. See
  [Free AI with Ollama](OLLAMA.md).
- **Idle servers**: Oracle may reclaim Always Free servers that stay almost completely idle for a
  week. Scheduled scans normally keep the server active enough. Upgrading the account to
  Pay-As-You-Go removes this risk, and Always Free resources stay free.

### Any other server with automatic HTTPS

This works on any Ubuntu VPS with 2+ vCPU and 4+ GB RAM (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Lightsail…). Either
run the same `server-setup.sh` command as above, or do it by hand:

```bash
# DNS: point your domain at the server, then:
scripts/init-env.sh      # private .env with generated secrets; then add your domain and API keys with an editor
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build      # or: make prod-up
```

Caddy obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate for `DOMAIN` automatically. It routes `/api/v1/*`, `/docs`
and `/health*` to the API and everything else to the dashboard. Set `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` once
your account exists. Set the Google redirect URI to `https://<DOMAIN>/api/v1/auth/google/callback`.
Back up the `pgdata` and `storage` volumes.
